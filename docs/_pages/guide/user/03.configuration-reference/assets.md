Assets are extra contents like files or links that are built or used during the release process. The most common example of a release asset is a changelog file but you can generate or use several others.

Some assets need to be produced by Nyx in the [make]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _pages/guide/user/02.introduction/how-nyx-works.md %}#make) task while others are created externally and just used. Regardless of their source, assets can also be consumed in several points. The most common way to consume a file asset is using a [template]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _pages/guide/user/03.configuration-reference/templates.md %}) that reads the entire [content]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _pages/guide/user/03.configuration-reference/templates.md %}#filecontent) of a file or just checks whether it [exists]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _pages/guide/user/03.configuration-reference/templates.md %}#fileexists) or not.

Assets are configured within the `assets` *section*. The section allows one sub-section for each asset and some overall options.

See the [examples]({{ site.baseurl }}/examples/) section for hints on how to configure assets.

### Asset definition

Within the `assets` block you can define as many assets as you want, each in its own separate block. The `name` identifies the asset so to define a brand new asset make sure you give it a `name` that was not already in use. If you use a `name` that was already defined for an asset (given the [evaluation order]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _pages/guide/user/02.introduction/configuration-methods.md %}#evaluation-order)) then you are **overriding** an existing asset. Depending on the [configuration method]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _pages/guide/user/02.introduction/configuration-methods.md %}) you use the `name` property might be defined inside or outside the block that configures a single asset.

Each asset has the following attributes:

| Name                                                                                       | Type    | Command Line Option                                                   | Environment Variable                                                    | Default                                              |

The path to the asset. It may be an URI or absolute or relative path to a local file.

If the asset has to be generated by an [service](#service), the supported path depends on the service itself.

The service to be used to generate the asset.

When this option is not defined Nyx assumes the asset is generated externally (manually or by other tools). On the other hand, when Nyx has to generate the asset, you need to give the [name]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _pages/guide/user/03.configuration-reference/services.md %}#name) of a configured [service]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _pages/guide/user/03.configuration-reference/services.md %}) supporting the `ASSET` [feature]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _pages/guide/user/03.configuration-reference/services.md %}#service-features). Such service will be invoked by the [Make]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _pages/guide/user/02.introduction/how-nyx-works.md %}#make) command to build the asset.
